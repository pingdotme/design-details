- **Team Members**: Define the roles and responsibilities of each team member, including project managers, software engineers, designers, quality assurance engineers, and product owners.

### 2. What
- **Project Objectives**: Clearly define the goals and objectives of the project. What is the software intended to achieve?
- **Requirements**: Gather and document both functional and non-functional requirements. What features and capabilities should the software have?
- **Scope**: Establish the boundaries of the project. What is included and what is excluded in the project deliverables?
- **Deliverables**: Outline the expected deliverables, such as design documents, source code, test plans, and user manuals.

### 3. When
- **Timeline**: Develop a project timeline that includes key milestones, deadlines, and delivery dates.
- **Schedule**: Create a detailed project schedule that outlines the phases of the project (e.g., planning, design, development, testing, deployment) and the time allocated for each phase.
- **Dependencies**: Identify dependencies between tasks and manage them to ensure smooth progress.

### 4. Where
- **Development Environment**: Define where the development will take place. This includes specifying the tools, platforms, and environments that will be used (e.g., development servers, testing environments, production environment).
- **Collaboration**: Determine where the team will collaborate, whether itâ€™s in a physical office, remotely, or using collaboration tools and platforms (e.g., GitHub, JIRA, Slack).
- **Hosting Strategy**: Decide on the hosting strategy for the application, including cloud providers, on-premises servers, or hybrid solutions.
- **Containers**: Specify the use of containers (e.g., Docker) for consistency across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Database**: Define the database strategy, including the type of database (SQL, NoSQL), database servers, and management tools.
- **CDN**: Plan the use of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) for improving the performance and reliability of content delivery.

### 5. How
- **Methodology**: Choose the development methodology to be used (e.g., Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, DevOps).
- **Design Phase**: 
  - **Software Architecture**: Define the overall architecture of the software, including monolithic, microservices, serverless, etc.
  - **Components**: Break down the system into components and define their interactions.
  - **Languages and Frameworks**: Specify the programming languages and frameworks to be used (e.g., Java, Python, React, Angular).
- **Development**: Outline the processes and workflows for coding, including code reviews, version control (e.g., Git), and branching strategies.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the testing and deployment of the software.
- **Deployment**: Plan the deployment process, including strategies like blue-green deployments, canary releases, and rollback mechanisms.
- **Ongoing Maintenance**: Define how ongoing maintenance will be handled, including bug fixes, updates, and feature enhancements.
- **Release Management**: Plan the release schedule and manage versioning and release notes.
- **Testing**: Implement testing strategies including unit tests, integration tests, system tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
- **Risk Management**: Identify potential risks and outline mitigation strategies.

### 6. Why
- **Purpose**: Explain the rationale behind the project. Why is this software being developed? What problem does it solve, or what opportunity does it address?
- **Benefits**: Highlight the benefits that the software will bring to stakeholders and end-users. Why is this project important to the organization or market?
- **Goals**: Define the success criteria and key performance indicators (KPIs) for the project. Why are these goals set, and how will they be measured?

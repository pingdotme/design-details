# PingMe Core System Overview

## Core Purpose
PingMe Core is an enterprise-grade, multi-tenant communication analytics platform designed for large telecommunications providers. It captures, analyses, and provides insights from voice communications whilst maintaining strict data isolation and compliance requirements.

## Key System Components

### Authentication & Authorisation
- Federated authentication supporting multiple identity providers
- Multi-tenant aware with organisation-level isolation
- RBAC with granular permissions at org/user levels
- Managed identity integration with Azure services
- Support for multiple client interfaces (mobile, web, desktop, desk phones)

### Voice Processing Pipeline
- Dual-stream VOIP audio capture
- Real-time transcription processing
- Multi-tenant aware audio storage
- Conversation analytics and insights generation
- Support for various telephony integrations

### Data Management
- Strict tenant isolation at all layers (network, compute, storage)
- Hierarchical data classification:
  - Level 1: Tenant-specific private data
  - Level 2: Anonymised industry data
  - Level 3: Aggregate insights
- Geographical data sovereignty compliance
- End-to-end encryption with tenant-specific keys

### Infrastructure (Azure-based)
- Multi-region Kubernetes deployment
- Network isolation using:
  - Dedicated VNets
  - NSG rules
  - Network policies
  - Private endpoints
- Resource isolation through:
  - Dedicated namespaces
  - Resource quotas
  - Pod security policies
  - Pod identity

### Analytics & Insights
- Organisation-level analytics for call centre performance
- Agent performance metrics and improvement suggestions
- Customer interaction analysis
- Per-tenant LLM training capabilities
- Knowledge base generation for AI chatbots
- Anonymised data pools for cross-organisation insights

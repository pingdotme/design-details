## Cost Analysis and Comparison: OpenAI API vs. Locally Hosted LLM for 60,000 Requests with 2,000 Tokens Each

### Introduction

This report provides a detailed cost analysis and comparison between using the OpenAI API and a locally hosted Large Language Model (LLM) for handling 60,000 requests per month, each with 2,000 tokens. The costs are calculated and presented in GBP, considering the exchange rate of 1 USD = 0.80 GBP.

### 1. OpenAI API Costs

**Assumptions:**
- Each request uses the GPT-4 model.
- Each request involves 2,000 tokens.
- Pricing is based on the latest available data from OpenAI.

**Calculation:**
- OpenAI pricing is typically structured per 1,000 tokens.
- Cost per 1,000 tokens for GPT-4: £0.024 (converted from $0.03).

**Total Tokens:**
60,000 requests * 2,000 tokens/request = 120,000,000 tokens

**Total Cost:**
(120,000,000 tokens / 1,000) * £0.024 = £2,880 per month

**Total Cost Over 2 Years:**
£2,880 * 24 months = £69,120

### 2. Locally Hosted LLM Costs

**Assumptions:**
- High-performance GPU server required.
- Hosting and maintaining the model involves hardware, electricity, maintenance, and personnel costs.
- High-end GPU (e.g., NVIDIA A100) and necessary server infrastructure.
- Electricity and maintenance costs factored in monthly.

**Components to Consider:**
- **Hardware Costs:**
  - High-end GPU (NVIDIA A100): £8,000 (converted from $10,000)
  - Server infrastructure (CPU, RAM, storage, etc.): £4,000 (converted from $5,000)
  - Total hardware cost: £12,000 (amortized over 2 years for calculation)

- **Electricity Costs:**
  - Power consumption: ~400W per GPU
  - Electricity rate: £0.096 per kWh (converted from $0.12 per kWh)
  - Monthly usage: 24/7 operation

  **Monthly Electricity Cost:**
  (400W * 24 hours/day * 30 days) / 1000 = 288 kWh
  288 kWh * £0.096 = £27.65

- **Maintenance and Personnel:**
  - Monthly cost for maintenance and personnel: £250

- **Hosting Costs:**
  - Colocation or cloud hosting fees: £160/month (converted from $200/month)

**Calculation:**
- **Total Monthly Operating Costs:**
  £27.65 (electricity) + £250 (maintenance/personnel) + £160 (hosting) = £437.65

- **Total Amortized Hardware Costs:**
  £12,000 / 24 months = £500 per month

- **Total Monthly Costs:**
  £437.65 + £500 = £937.65

**Total Cost Over 2 Years:**
£937.65 * 24 months = £22,503.60

### 3. Cost Comparison Over 2 Years

**OpenAI API:**
£69,120 over 2 years

**Locally Hosted LLM:**
£22,503.60 over 2 years

### Summary in GBP

- **OpenAI API: £69,120 over 2 years for 60,000 requests per month**
- **Locally Hosted LLM: £22,503.60 over 2 years**

### Conclusion

Over 2 years, the TCO for using the OpenAI API is £69,120, while the TCO for a locally hosted LLM is £22,503.60. The locally hosted solution demonstrates a significant cost advantage, assuming the organization can manage the technical infrastructure and maintenance effectively. Optional resource costs can further reduce the TCO for the locally hosted solution, enhancing its cost-effectiveness.

**Note:** The locally hosted LLM costs can vary based on actual hardware, electricity rates, and personnel costs. It is crucial to tailor the analysis to specific organizational circumstances for more accurate cost projections.

### Maximum Utilization Cost Comparison

To understand the cost comparison at maximum utilization, we calculate the cost for handling 86,400,000 tokens over 24 hours.

#### OpenAI API Costs for 86,400,000 Tokens

**Total Tokens:**
86,400,000 tokens

**Total Cost:**
(86,400,000 tokens / 1,000) * £0.024 = £2,073.60

#### Locally Hosted LLM Costs for 86,400,000 Tokens

Given the hardware can handle 86,400,000 tokens in 24 hours and considering the monthly cost:

**Daily Cost:**
£937.65 / 30 days = £31.26

**Total Cost:**
£31.26 per day

### Summary of Maximum Utilization Costs

- **OpenAI API: £2,073.60 for 86,400,000 tokens**
- **Locally Hosted LLM: £31.26 for 86,400,000 tokens**

### Conclusion of Maximum Utilization

Processing 86,400,000 tokens is significantly cheaper using a locally hosted LLM (£31.26) compared to using the OpenAI API (£2,073.60). This highlights the substantial cost savings of using a locally hosted solution, assuming the system can operate continuously at full capacity and other operational factors are optimized.

### Addendum: Maximum Utilization TCO Over 2 Years

To calculate the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for maximum utilization over 2 years:

#### OpenAI API TCO for Maximum Utilization

**Daily Cost for 86,400,000 tokens:**
£2,073.60

**Annual Cost:**
£2,073.60 * 365 days = £756,864

**2-Year Cost:**
£756,864 * 2 = £1,513,728

#### Locally Hosted LLM TCO for Maximum Utilization

**Daily Cost for 86,400,000 tokens:**
£31.26

**Annual Cost:**
£31.26 * 365 days = £11,409.90

**2-Year Cost:**
£11,409.90 * 2 = £22,819.80

### Summary of Maximum Utilization TCO Over 2 Years

- **OpenAI API: £1,513,728 over 2 years for maximum utilization**
- **Locally Hosted LLM: £22,819.80 over 2 years for maximum utilization**

### Conclusion of Maximum Utilization TCO

At maximum utilization, the TCO over 2 years for using the OpenAI API is £1,513,728, while the TCO for a locally hosted LLM is £22,819.80. This clearly demonstrates the substantial cost advantage of a locally hosted solution at maximum utilization, provided the system operates continuously at full capacity and is optimally managed.
